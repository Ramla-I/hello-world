# hello-world
My first ever repository!!!

Salam everybody. So, I'm a recent EE grad with a passion for well, learning. I love intellectual environments and may be considered as something of a nerd :) I'm also an avid reader, give me anything: novels, poetry, history, biographies... Books are my way to understand the chaotic mess this world seems to be. Currently, I'm trying to learn 2 new languages: Urdu and Arabic. So, hopefully I'll get somewhere with that. I believe in the universal goal of education for all and oh yes, pulao > biryani anyday :D
